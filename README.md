ðŸ“° News Article Summarizer

This project is a web-based application that summarizes long news articles using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages the BART transformer model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) and the CNN/DailyMail dataset to automatically generate concise, readable summaries.

The app was developed as part of a school project and showcases how modern NLP models can be applied to real-world text processing tasks. It includes a custom preprocessing pipeline that handles articles exceeding the modelâ€™s token limit by applying sentence-based chunking.
